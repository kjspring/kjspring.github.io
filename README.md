# Hello!

While I was completing my Ph.D. in evolutionary biology from the University of Houston, I fell in love with coding and data analytics. I am currently looking for full-time Data Analytics or Data Science opportunities. If you know of any positions available or would just like to say hi, feel free to email me at, [kevinjspring@gmail.com](mailto:kevinjspring@gmail.com).
